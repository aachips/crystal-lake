Simple Choices and Navigation:

    Right now, you have buttons that trigger section changes based on their onclick attribute.
    You can convert this into a JavaScript function that takes the target section ID as an argument and uses document.getElementById to show/hide sections.

JavaScript

function showSection(sectionId) {
  // Hide all sections
  const sections = document.querySelectorAll(".container");
  sections.forEach(section => section.classList.remove("active"));

  // Show the clicked section
  const targetSection = document.getElementById(sectionId);
  targetSection.classList.add("active");
}

Use code with caution.

    Update your button onclick attributes to call this function with the appropriate section ID.

2. Keeping Track of Player Choices (Optional):

    You can introduce a simple JavaScript object to store player choices throughout the game. This allows you to tailor the experience based on their investigation path.

JavaScript

const playerChoices = {
  talkedTo: "", // Sheriff, Doctor, or Store Owner
  confronted: null, // Factory or Other (later)
  evidenceFound: [], // Array of evidence IDs
};

function updateChoice(choice) {
  playerChoices[choice.property] = choice.value;
}

Use code with caution.

    Modify your button clicks to update the playerChoices object with the chosen character or action.

3. Adding Simple Quizzes (Optional):

    After information sections, you can add short quizzes using JavaScript to reinforce key points and make the learning aspect more interactive.

JavaScript

function takeQuiz(sectionId, questions) {
  // Display quiz questions and options
  // Use JavaScript to evaluate answers and provide feedback
}

Use code with caution.

    Create an array of question objects with text, answer options, and correct answers.
    Call the takeQuiz function after displaying relevant information and allow the player to answer before continuing.

4. Randomized Elements (Optional):

    You can introduce a bit of surprise by randomizing certain aspects of the game using JavaScript's Math.random() function.

JavaScript

function getRandomSocialPost() {
  const posts = [
    // ... Define different social media post options
  ];
  const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * posts.length);
  return posts[randomIndex];
}

Use code with caution.

    Implement this function to display a random social media post on each visit to the social media section, keeping the player guessing.

Learning Opportunity:

These are just a few basic examples to get you started. As you progress in your JavaScript course, you can explore more advanced concepts like:

    Event Listeners: Instead of relying on inline onclick attributes, you can use event listeners to make your code more modular and reusable.
    DOM Manipulation: You can go beyond showing/hiding sections and dynamically create elements based on player choices or game events.
    Conditional Logic: Use if statements and other conditionals to tailor the game experience based on player choices and the playerChoices object.

By experimenting with these functionalities, you can create a more engaging and dynamic game while solidifying your understanding of JavaScript functions and concepts.
