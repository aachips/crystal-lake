    <h1>Welcome, Detective!</h1>
    <p>The idyllic town of Pinewood Creek is in crisis. Crystal Lake, once a beloved local treasure, has been contaminated by unknown pollutants. As a skilled investigator, you've been called upon to crack the case and uncover the source of the contamination.</p>

    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>This is a choose-your-own-adventure style game where YOU control the investigation. You'll encounter a variety of characters, sift through news reports and social media feeds, and explore different locations in your search for clues. Be mindful of the information you receive, not everything is as it seems!</p>

    <h2>How to Play</h2>

        <li>Throughout the game, you'll be presented with choices. These choices could involve interacting with characters, reading information sources, or investigating locations.</li>
        <li>Each choice will lead you down a different path, revealing new information and shaping the course of your investigation.</li>
        <li>Pay close attention to the details you uncover. Some information will be helpful, while some might be misleading or downright false. Use your critical thinking skills to separate fact from fiction.</li>
        <li>At the end of each investigation phase, you'll face a quiz to test your understanding of the case and the information you've gathered.</li>
        <li>There's no single "right" way to play. Explore different paths, make choices, and see where the investigation leads you. You might uncover the truth, get misled by a decoy, or even encounter danger! The choice is yours.</li>
    </ul>
